<h1>Learning HTML</h1>

<p>You will be learning how to program web pages by completing a series of assignments of gradually increasing difficulty. Each assignment will be represented by a common spider (the original web builders). Spider pictures are from the Spiders.us database. When you have completed a level, you will be given a link to the next level. Your mark will depend on how many levels you complete and on how well you learn and use the HTML tags.</p>

<h1>House Spider: Create a web page about yourself</h1>

<h3>Expectations:</h3>
<p><b>A3.</b>&nbsp;use the basic functions of an operating system correctly;<br>
<b>B2.</b>&nbsp;plan and write simple programs using fundamental programming concepts;<br>
<b>Connect:</b>&nbsp;Application of knowledge and skills in familiar contexts, in new contexts, and making connections within and between contexts.<br>
<b>Code:</b>&nbsp;Using the conventions and syntax of computer programming languages correctly so that the code performs as intended.</p>

<p>Follow the HTML tutorials at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a> to learn how to use Hypertext Markup Language tags.</p>

<p>Use "Notepad" to create your own web page. When you save it, use the extension ".html" instead of the default ".txt". If you want to continue editing the file in Notepad, open Notepad first, or right-click on the file name and select "Open with".</p>

<p>The content of this web page should be to tell your classmates who you are, what you are interested in and some things you are proud of. This web page will eventually be made visible to the world, so do NOT include your full name, your e-mail address nor anything that would enable strangers to contact you.</p>

<p>The HTML tags you must include are the basic ones that occur in every web page, head, title , body, headings, paragraphs. You may include others as you wish - show off what you have learned!</p>

<p>When you have created and saved this web page file, use Notepad to re-open the "index.html" file that you created earlier. Edit this file to include a link to your new web page. For example, if you created a web page file called "Richard.html", then you should include this line of code in your "index.html" file:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href="Richard.html"&gt;About me&lt;/a&gt;<p>

<p>Save your edited "index.html" file, then open your Google Drive folder, remove the old "index.html" file, then upload both of your new html files.</p>
